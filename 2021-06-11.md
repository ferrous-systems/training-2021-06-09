Please feel free to ask any questions!

Step five: Assert sent data is the same as received data!

```rust
assert_eq!(sent_data, rxed_data);
```

# Serde

Serializing, Deserialize

## "Frontend" -> Data centric part

Serde Data Model:

A set of building blocks to describe certain common data type (and data patterns)

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct MyMessage {
    payload: String,
    msg_id: u64,
    details: InnerMessage,
    fancy: MyFancyDataType,
}

// Not today:
//
// impl serde::Serialize for MyFancyDataType {
//     // ...
// }
//
// impl serde::Deserialize for MyFancyDataType {
//     // ...
// }

// attribute (procedural) macro
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct InnerMessage {
    fav_num: u16,
    fav_show: String,
}
```

We have not said ANYTHING about a specific data format.

We know Serde supports formats like:

* JSON
* YAML
* TOML
* bincode
* postcard

**Summary**: The frontend handles (Rust Data Types) <-> (Serde Data Model)

## "Backend" -> Format-specific part

Is how we support multiple kinds of [de]serialization formats.

(Examples of) Wire formats:

* JSON
* YAML
* TOML
* bincode
* postcard

```rust
use serde_json::to_string as json_to_string;
use toml::to_string as toml_to_string;

fn main() {
    let x = MyMessage::new();
    let ser = json_to_string(&x).unwrap();
    println!("{}", ser);
    let ser = toml_to_string(&x).unwrap();
    println!("{}", ser);
}
```

(Serde Data Model) <-> (Some wire format)


## Putting it together

(Rust Data Types) <-> (Serde Data Model)
  |                          ^
  | Serialize                | Deserialize
  v                          |
(Serde Data Model) <-> (Some wire format)

# Custom Serde Exercise

**Current status: Waiting for folks to join! Please ask questions
if you have troubles with steps 1-5!**

1. Create a new library crate called `protocol`
    * `cargo new --lib protocol`
2. Add `serde` to your dependencies of protocol
    * You may need to enable the `derive` feature of serde
3. Add the `protocol` crate as a dependency of both your client and server
4. Add `serde_json` as a dependency to your client and server
5. (make sure you can build all three crates at this point)

6. Define a message type (in `protocol`) that should include AT LEAST:
    * A string payload
    * A u64 "message id" field
7. Instead of sending plain text as a loopback:
    * Have the client generate, serialize, and send a serialized json message
    * Have the server receive, deserialize, and look at the message
    * Have the server (for now) increment the message id by one, then:
    * Have the server generate, serialize, and send a serialized json response
    * Have the client deserialize, etc. the message, and verify it was as expected


* With `serde_json` you might want to look at the:
    * `from_str` method
    * `to_string` method


## relatively quick multithreaded changeover

1. Implement a multithreaded client that will spawn 10 requests
    * And wait for all threads to `join()`
2. Modify single threaded server:
    * SLEEP for three seconds, after receiving data, but before responding
3. Implement a multithreaded server, BUT
    * Spawn one thread per incoming connection
    * Keep the sleep
4. Keep track of the number of bytes received, and add the current number to the
    request ID when you respond to it (current number AFTER the sleep)
    * Global Atomic Integer, and use atomic operations
        * Totally reasonable for this
    * `Arc<Mutex<usize>>`, which is overkill for this, but we will need for the
        next step

```rust
// to spawn a thread
for x in 0..10 {
    // Doing the clone outside the "closure
    // capture", to avoid capturing "our"
    // handle to the data, and moving it to
    // the new thread.
    let arc_clone = arc.clone();
    let hdl = std::thread::spawn(move || {
        // `move` here means: Any variable we
        //   use from the outer scope, will be
        //   passed by ownership to the new thread
        //
        // Code run in other thread goes here
        arc_clone.todo();
    });
}

// to wait for the thread to join:
hdl.join(); // blocking call!
// Result
//   Ok(): Thread terminated "successfully"
//   Err(): Thread "panic'd"

// Create
let my_arc = Arc::new(42);

// DOES NOT COPY THE DATA
// It only increment the reference count, and
// creates a new "arc handle"
let clone_arc = my_arc.clone();
```

## Command and Response

1. We would like a Request (for client -> server) type that has two options:
    * GET (with no data)
    * SET (with some data)
    * These changes live in our `protocol` definition
2. We would like a Response (for server -> client) type that has two options:
    * If the Client requested a GET, return the data (serialized)
    * If the Client requested a SET, return some kind of OK message
    * These changes live in our `protocol` definition
3. Change our client and server to serialize + deserialize the right types
4. Our server should listen to the incoming Request type, and perform the
    requested action
5. We should update our "shared state" to contain the current/latest set value


New flow:

```
Client -----Request----> Server
                          ...
Client <----Response---- Server
```
